//! Digital signatures according to the [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) specification.
//!
//! Digital signatures are used by Matrix homeservers to verify the authenticity
//! of events in the Matrix system, as well as requests between homeservers for
//! federation. Each homeserver has one or more signing key pairs (sometimes
//! referred to as "verify keys") which it uses to sign all events and
//! federation requests. Matrix clients and other Matrix homeservers can ask the
//! homeserver for its public keys and use those keys to verify the signed data.
//!
//! Each signing key pair has an identifier, which consists of the name of the
//! digital signature algorithm it uses and a "version" string, separated by a
//! colon. The version is an arbitrary identifier used to distinguish key pairs
//! using the same algorithm from the same homeserver.
//!
//! Arbitrary JSON objects can be signed as well as JSON representations of
//! Matrix events. In both cases, the signatures are stored within the JSON
//! object itself under a `signatures` key. Events are also required to contain
//! hashes of their content, which are similarly stored within the hashed JSON
//! object under a `hashes` key.
//!
//! In JSON representations, both signatures and hashes appear as base64-encoded
//! strings, using the standard character set, without padding.
//!
//! # Signing and hashing
//!
//! To sign an arbitrary JSON object, use the `sign_json` function. See the
//! documentation of this function for more details and a full example of use.
//!
//! Signing an event uses a more complicated process than signing arbitrary
//! JSON, because events can be redacted, and signatures need to remain valid
//! even if data is removed from an event later. HomeServers are required to
//! generate hashes of event contents as well as signing events before
//! exchanging them with other homeservers. Although the algorithm for hashing
//! and signing an event is more complicated than for signing arbitrary JSON,
//! the interface to a user of palpo-signatures is the same. To hash and sign an
//! event, use the `hash_and_sign_event` function. See the documentation of this
//! function for more details and a full example of use.
//!
//! # Verifying signatures and hashes
//!
//! When a homeserver receives data from another homeserver via the federation,
//! it's necessary to verify the authenticity and integrity of the data by
//! verifying their signatures.
//!
//! To verify a signature on arbitrary JSON, use the `verify_json` function. To
//! verify the signatures and hashes on an event, use the `verify_event`
//! function. See the documentation for these respective functions for more
//! details and full examples of use.
