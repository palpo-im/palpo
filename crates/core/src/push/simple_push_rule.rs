//! Common types for the [push notifications module][push].
//!
//! [push]: https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#push-notifications
//!
//! ## Understanding the types of this module
//!
//! Push rules are grouped in `RuleSet`s, and are grouped in five kinds (for
//! more details about the different kind of rules, see the `Ruleset` documentation,
//! or the specification). These five kinds are, by order of priority:
//!
//! - override rules
//! - content rules
//! - room rules
//! - sender rules
//! - underride rules
