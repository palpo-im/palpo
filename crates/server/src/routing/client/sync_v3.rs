/// #GET /_matrix/client/r0/sync
/// Synchronize the client's state with the latest state on the server.
///
/// - This endpoint takes a `since` parameter which should be the `next_batch` value from a
/// previous request for incremental syncs.
///
/// Calling this endpoint without a `since` parameter returns:
/// - Some of the most recent events of each timeline
/// - Notification counts for each room
/// - Joined and invited member counts, heroes
/// - All state events
///
/// Calling this endpoint with a `since` parameter from a previous `next_batch` returns:
/// For joined rooms:
/// - Some of the most recent events of each timeline that happened after since
/// - If user joined the room after since: All state events (unless lazy loading is activated) and
/// all device list updates in that room
/// - If the user was already in the room: A list of all events that are in the state now, but were
/// not in the state at `since`
/// - If the state we send contains a member event: Joined and invited member counts, heroes
/// - Device list updates that happened after `since`
/// - If there are events in the timeline we send or the user send updated his read mark: Notification counts
/// - EDUs that are active now (read receipts, typing updates, presence)
/// - TODO: Allow multiple sync streams to support Pantalaimon
///
/// For invited rooms:
/// - If the user was invited after `since`: A subset of the state of the room at the point of the invite
///
/// For left rooms:
/// - If the user left after `since`: prev_batch token, empty state (TODO: subset of the state at the point of the leave)
///
/// - Sync is handled in an async task, multiple requests from the same device with the same
/// `since` will be cached
