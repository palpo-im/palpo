# =============================================================================
#  This is the official example config for Palpo.
#  If you use it for your server, you will need to adjust it to your own needs.
#  At the very least, change the server_name field!
# =============================================================================

# The server_name is the pretty name of this server. It is used as a suffix for user
# and room ids. Examples: matrix.org, palpo.im

# The Palpo server needs all /_matrix/ requests to be reachable at
# https://your.server.name/ on port 443 (client-server) and 8448 (federation).

# If that's not possible for you, you can create /.well-known files to redirect
# requests. See
# https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest#get-well-known-matrix-client
# and
# https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.4#get-well-known-matrix-server
# for more information

# YOU NEED TO EDIT THIS

# Palpo handles the /.well-known/matrix/* endpoints, making both clients and servers try to access palpo with the host
# server_name and port 443 by default.
# If you want to override these defaults, uncomment and edit the following lines accordingly:
